# Slider Accessibility Enhancements

## Overview

Based on the provided accessibility requirements, the slider component has been enhanced to provide better keyboard navigation, visual feedback, and overall accessibility. The changes focus on ensuring that the slider meets Material Design accessibility standards and provides appropriate feedback based on input type.

## Key Enhancements

### Focus and Keyboard Navigation

- **Direct Thumb Focus**: The initial focus now lands directly on the handle (not the container)
- **Visual Feedback**: Added a clear outline on focus to provide visual cues for keyboard users
- **Arrow Key Navigation**:
  - Left/Right arrows change the value by one step
  - Up/Down arrows also change the value (for consistency with other controls)
  - Home/End keys jump to minimum/maximum values
  - Page Up/Down for larger step increments
  - Shift + arrows for faster navigation (10x step size)

### Visual Feedback During Interaction

- **Thumb Shrinking**: The handle width shrinks slightly during interaction to provide feedback
- **Value Display**:
  - Value appears during interaction (touch, drag, mouse click, keyboard navigation)
  - Value remains visible briefly after interaction ends (1.5 seconds)
  - Value position updates to follow the handle

### Visual Anchors for Contrast

- **Track End Indicators**: Added dot elements at both ends of the track
- **Color Contrast**: Ensured sufficient contrast for all elements
- **Disabled State**: Properly indicated visually and via ARIA attributes
